		<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
		   <article>
		      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to structure a web page and it's content.For examplw, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this section will cover the basics of HTML and it's functions.</p>
		  
		<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
		   
		      <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you can enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. For example, look at the following lone of content</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/mycat.PNG" alt="">
			   <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that by enclosing it in paragraph tags</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/mycatWcode.PNG" alt="">
		   
		<h2>The Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
		  
		       <img src="resources/images/elementAnTOMY.png" alt="">
			   <p>The main parts of the HTML element are:</p>
			   <ol>
			     <li><em>The opening tag</em>: This is the name of the element (in this case, p) wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect - in this case where the paragraph begins</li>
				   <br>
				 <li><em>The Closing Tag</em>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a foward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends - in this case, where the paragraph ends. failing to add the closing tag is one of the beginner errors and can lead to stramge results. </li>
				   <br>
				 <li><em>The Content</em>: This is the content of the element. which in this case is just text.</li>
				   <br>
				 <li><em>The Element</em>: The opening tag and the closing tag coming together with the content to create the element.</li>
			   </ol>
			   <p>Elements can also have attributes</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="">
			   <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here 'class ' is the attribute name and 'editor-note' is the attrubute value.The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (any other element with the same class value) with style information and other things
				   <br><br>
			   An attribute should always have the following</p>
			   <br>
			   <ol>
			     <li> A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element has more than one attribiue).</li>
				   <br>
				 <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
				   <br>
				 <li>The attribute value wrapped in quotation marks.</li>
			   </ol>
		   
		 <h3>Nesting Elements</h3>
		   
			   <p>You can put elements inside other elements too - this is called <strong>nesting</strong> if we wanted to say that our cat was very grumpy we woulf wrap the word very in a 'strong' element, therefore we would have to close the 'strong' element, then the 'p' element</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/strongelement.PNG" alt="">
			   <p>However, you needd to make sure that youe elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the 'p' element firdt then the 'strong' element , therefore we have to close the 'strong' tag before the 'p' tag. The folowing is incorrect</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/incorrectNesting.PNG" alt="">
			 <h3>Empty Elements</h3> 
			   <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the 'img' element that we already have in our HTML page</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/imgelement.PNG" alt="">
			   <p>This contains two attributes, but there's no closing tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appeears</p>
			 <h2>The Anatomy of an HTML Document</h2>
			   <p>That wraps up the basics of idividual HTML elements. Now we look at how individual elements behave when they are combined to form an entire HTML page.</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/htmlcombo.PNG" alt="">
			   <p>Here we have the following</p>
			   <ul>
			     <li><strong>doctype</strong>. It is a required preamble. in the midst of time , when HTML was young, doctypes werre meant to act as links to the set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which would mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they dont do much and are basically just needed to make sure the document behaves correctly.</li>
				   <br>
				 <li><strong>the HTML element</strong>. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometomes known as the root element.</li>
				   <br>
				 <li><strong>the head element</strong>. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to incude on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's users. This includes things like keywords and a page discription that you want to appear in the search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more</li>
				   <br>
				 <li><strong> meta & charset elements</strong>. This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which icudes most characters from the vast majority of written language. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
				   <br>
				 <p><strong>The Title element</strong>. This element sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. it is also used to describe the page when you bookmark it.</p>
				   <br>
				  <p><strong>The Body Element</strong>. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or whatever else.</p>
			   </ul>
			 <h2>Images</h2>
			   <img src="resources/images/imgelement.PNG" alt="">
			   <p>As it was mentioned earlier, the 'img' tag embeds an image into the page in the position that it appears. It does this via the 'src' attribite, which contains the path to the image file.<br><br>
			   We incude an 'alt' attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly for the following reasons.
			   </p>
			   <ol>
			     <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them</li>
				  <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display.</li>
			   </ol>
			   <h2>Marking Up Text</h2>
			     <p>This section covers some of the essential HTML elements used to mark up text. </p>
			   <h3>Headings</h3>
			   <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings or subheadings. In the same way that a book has a main title, chapters and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels.</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/headings.PNG" alt="">
			   <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
				<p>Elements for conaing ing paragraphs</p>
			    <img src="resources/images/paragraph element.PNG" alt="">
			   <h3>Lists</h3>
			     <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists</p>
			     <ol>
				    <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesnt matter. these are wrapped by a 'ul' element</li>
					 <li><strong>Ordered list</strong> are lists where the order matters. these are wrapped in a 'ol' element</li>
			     </ol>
			   <p>Each item inside the the list is put insde a 'li' element</p>
			   <img src="resources/images/lists.PNG" alt="">
			   <h2>Links</h2>
			   <p>Links are very important, they are what makes the web a web. To add a link we need to use the 'a' element, being short for anchor.The following steps are to turn text in your paragraph into a link</p>
			   <ol>
			      <li>wrap the text in a 'a' element
				   <img src="resources/images/link1.PNG" alt=""></li>
				   <li>Give the 'a' element a 'href' attribute.<img src="resources/images/link2.PNG" alt=""></li>
				   <li>Fill the value of the attribute with thw web adress you want the link to link to. <img src="resources/images/link3.PNG" alt=""></li>
			   </ol>

		      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles the web content.</p>
<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
			<p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language either. <strong>CSS is a stylesheet language</strong>. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements, for example, this CSS selects thhe paragraph texts , setting the colour to red.</p>
			<img src="resources/images/css1.PNG" alt="">
			<p>To make the code work it must be linked to your HTML  document in the 'head' element</p>
			<img src="resources/images/css2.PNG" alt="">
			<h2>The Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
			<img src="resources/images/css3.PNG" alt="">
			<p>The whole structure is called a <em>ruleset</em>. Note the names of the individual parts</p>
			<ul>
			    <li><strong>Selector</strong><br>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, 'p' element) to style a different element change the selector</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Declaration</strong><br>This is a single rule like color: red;. its specifies which of the element's properties you want to style</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Properties</strong><br>
				These are ways in whic you can style an HTML element.(in this example, colour is the property of the 'p' element). In CSS you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Property Value</strong><br>
				To the right of the property, after the colon, is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other important parts of the syntax:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped with curle braces {}</li>
				<li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon to separate the property from it's value(s).</li>
				<li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon to separate each declaration from the next one</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To modify multiple property values, write them separated by semicolons like this:</p>
			<img src="resources/images/css4.PNG" alt="">
			<h3>Selecting multiple elements</h3>
			<p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset for all of them. Separate multiple selectors with commas like this:</p>
			<img src="resources/images/css5.PNG" alt="">
			<h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
			<p>There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use <stong>element selectors</stong> which select all the elements of a given type. But we can also make more specific selectioms as well. Here are are some of the more common types of selectors</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<th>Selector Name</th>
					<th>What does it select?</th>
					<th>Example</th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Element Selector</td>
						<td>All HTML elements of the specified type</td>
						<td>P selects the paragraph elementt</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ID selector</td>
						<td>The element on the page with a specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique</td>
						<td>#my-id selects <span class="code">&lt;p id="my-id"&gt;</span> or a <span class="code">&lt;a id="my-id"&gt;</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Class selector</td>
						<td>The elements(s) on the page within the page with a specified class. Multiole instances of the same class can appear on the same page</td>
						<td>.my-class selects <span class="code">&lt;p class="my-class"&gt;</span>and <span class="code">&lt;a class="my-id"&gt;</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Attribute Selector</td>
						<td>The element(s) on the page with a specific atribute.</td>
						<td>img[src] selects <span class="code">&lt;img src="myimage.png"&gt;</span> but not <span class="code">&lt;img&gt;</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
						<td>The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state (for example, when a cursor hovers over a link)</td>
						<td>a: hover selects <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over a link.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
